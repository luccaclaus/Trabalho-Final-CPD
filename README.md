# FIFA Players: CSV Database Search Project
This project was made as the final assesment for the Data Analysis (Cassificação e Pesquisa de Dados) class in the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). 
<br>
The project consists of reading 3 different files from a database (Players, Ratings and Tags) and building data structres, such as Hash Tables and Trie Trees (all built from scratch) that allow the user to perform searches within the database. These searches go from getting the top players at a certain position, to getting a player's data by searching a prefix of his name, or even getting all the reviews that a certain user has given to different players.
<br>
Here are examples of the structure of the 3 CSV files that are read to create the structures:
